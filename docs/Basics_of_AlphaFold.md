## We are entering an AI revolution

  Many tools such as ChatGPT are emerging to help bioinformaticists get their work done.
  
  One of the first tools with a big impact on the community was AlphaFold in 2018, which has now become AlphaFold2.
  
  AlphaFold offered the possibility of finding evolutionary changes using 3D structures for proteins from many different organisms, even when no extra laboratory work had been done beside sequencing.
  
  As it lept forward, AlphaFold also remained very similar to existing bioinformatics paradigms such as MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) while adding newer strategies such as neural network modeling.
  
  Sergey Ovchinnikov put together a nice presentation that explained this progression, let's take a look at a few of his [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnffk23ev2QMDzGZ5w1skXEadTe54l8-Uei6ACce8eI/edit#slide=id.ge58aabdb42_0_2372)
  
 This slide presentation to the Boston Protein Design and Modeling Club was part of a much longer video on Youtube which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfw7thgGTwI)
