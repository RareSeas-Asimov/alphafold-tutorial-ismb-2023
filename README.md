## Workshop Schedule 

### Note: Times are relative to the start and end times of the Tutorial

0:00:00 - 0:15:00 Introductory Lecture on the Protein Folding Problem and Artificial Intelligence Approach to the Solution 

0:15:00 - 0:30:00 Introduction to the AlphaFold Tools and Database 

0:30:00 - 0:45:00 Setting up the virtual environment for executing the tools 
—- This now becomes running Colab Notebooks, since we are not at Tufts

0:45:00 - 1:45:00 Hands On Activity 

* Introduction to the Data Set used 
* Introduction to the Compute Environment 
* Introduction to the Alphafold Command Line Parameters
*   View the Code in the [Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb) 
* Run Alphafold on Command Line or using the form  —- NOTEBOOKS
* Review Alphafold results (RELAXED vs RELAXED_GPU)
* Download Alphafold results 


1:45:00 - 2:00:00 Coffee Break 
2:00:00 - 2:20:00 Introduction to PyMoL and other Protein Viewers (e.g. Cn3D) 
2:20:00 - 2:30:00 Setting up PyMoL on your own machine or logging into the VM open source PyMoL  OR, if student does not have access to PyMoL for some reason, let’s have a Notebook with Cn3D viewer available for the exercise just in case
2:30:00 - 3:30:00 Hands On Activity 

* Loading files into PyMOL
* Picking residues to highlight 
* Other options in PyMOL for examining the protein structure 

* What have we learned from the visualizations? 
* What other questions might we ask? 

3:30:00 - 3:45:00 Discussion session: How can this tool be applied to your research question? 
3:45:00 - 4:00:00 Wrap up Lecture on Future Directions for AI and Resources for Further Study
